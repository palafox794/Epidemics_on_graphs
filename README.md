# Epidemics_on_graphs
Code for a simulation of a Markovian SIR epidemic spreading on a network. Created for expository reasons.

Notebook 'markovian_sir_on_network.ipynb' is a Python jupyter notebook where the simulation was performed.

Data resulting from this simulation is exported as 'network_data.csv', and analysed in the R jupyter notebook 'data_analysis.ipynb'.

The network where the epidemic spreads is obtained from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html, and saved in the "facebook_combined.txt" file.
